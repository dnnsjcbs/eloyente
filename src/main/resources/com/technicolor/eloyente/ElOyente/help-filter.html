<div>
	<p>
		If empty, the job will be triggered for any event occuring on the selected
		node.  The filter expression allows the job to be triggered only if the event
		matches a certain criterium.  The filter is a boolean expression in
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/">XPath notation</a>, which is applied on the
		XMPP event.  If the boolean expression evaluates to true, the job is triggered.
		See <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html">XEP-0060</a> for more
		information about XMPP Pub/Sub.
