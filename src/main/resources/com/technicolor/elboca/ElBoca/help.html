		<u>El Boca</u> (The Speaker: Spanish)

	<p>
		Sends an xmpp PubSub-event to an xmpp server.
		on which ElOyente could start a build.
		
	</p>
	<p>
		This plugin integrates XMPP Pub/Sub into Jenkins, which allows jobs started on different
		jenkins servers. This is done through the ElOyente plugin, which picks up the sent
		events, and starts the actual builds.
